                        <strong>Overview of the General Topic</strong>
                        <div>
                            The pandemic has changed everyone's life, and one of the most significant ways it changes
                            people's life is through quarantine. Because of the existence of pandemic, people are not
                            able to go out and get in touch with other human beings like before. Instead, they have to
                            stay at home to avoid as much as contacting with other people as they could. In fact, many 
                            things that people have worried about are actually not a problem for nowadays. People can
                            talk with their friends through message application or video talking applicaiton. There
                            are many application like instacart that helps people with shopping grocery stuff. Netflix
                            is definition a good choice for dealing with boring time... As for me, the biggest problem
                            is, without the constraints from other people and the general public, how can people manage
                            their life in a regular mode? For example, for college students like me, befroe quarantine, 
                            even though sometimes we were just too lazy to get up to go to a class, or just too tired to
                            start doing an assignment or reviewing, but if this class had no recording, or this class had
                            participation point, or our roomates had already got up, or the studying atmosphere of the 
                            library... There were always so many factors from the physical boundary that we were living 
                            in--college--forced us to get up and do right things. However, during quarantine, everybody
                            is like being isolated in an island. We are no longer have that close relationship with our
                            surrouding environemnt. At this time, it gradually becomes a big problem for many to manage
                            their life. How to live like on college campus when you are actually in your comfort home?

                        <div>
                            As there is no such big scale of quarantine has happended before (maybe there are, but most
                            of them are from pretty old time), this app is not able to provide any effective information
                            about how to live a good life during quarantine to the user. </br>
                            But there are helpful resources that would help to build this app in a scientific way:

                            Those apps that are aiming for recording daily life, no matter in the form of video recording
                            or traditional writing, could be identified as existing attempts to help with this topics. As
                            by recording their life everyday, people are better able to realize what life they are living
                            everyday and implementing changes.

                            Other people's recording life. In other words, the way other people are using to manage their
                            life during quarantine. In conclusion, this app would offer a place for user to record their
                            everyday of quarantine life, set goals and plan for quarantine life. And they can not only 
                            recording their own life, but also viewing other users' recording and hope to also live a normal
                            life during quarantine.

                        <div>
                            The user will be able to record their everyday life on the app. It will not be like writing a
                            long blog as long paragraph is hard for people to focus on. Instead, the app will be like a 
                            questionaire that asks the user many questions everyday. Users can design their own everyday
                            questions or use the default questions the app offer. There will also be space for the user to
                            DIY their everyday recording to make it as colorful and interesting as they want. This app is 
                            aiming for living good life in qurantine, so it will only focus on quarantine, not like other
                            normal recording life application like doing diaries everyday, and doing vlog everyday, etc.

                            their life during quarantine. I hope by using this app, they could be able to find a living pattern 
                            that suits their livign habits and work/study/relax requirements and follow it regualrly everyday.
